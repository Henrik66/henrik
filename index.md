# The experience of Debate

##  Preparation

All debates need preparation, in fact, you could argue that the way your argument is organized and the content of it is more important than the way you deliver it to the judges and your opponent. Your speech needs to not only have your arguments but also counter-arguments to oppose the opponent and what they are saying.

Although you do not get much time, squeezing in more information can make a huge difference. Wasting time is also costly so don&#39;t talk too fast. Tripping over words will hurt and it is best to make sure that judges understand you

The simplest way to get all of your information down is to write bullet points when doing research. You should always have your bullets organized though. For example, I organize each set of bullet points to one argument, and my arguments and rebuttals are separated. This way, when I write my speeches, I have all the information that I need where I need it. 1 argument should be long enough for the judges to understand the point you're making, but not too long because you want to fit in as many cases as possible.

## How I Do it

Rebuttals are different. The way I like to seek out my opponent's main points is by research their side of the topic. Using what I find most common will most likely be 1 of their arguments. So I can then find counter-arguments to disprove what my rival is saying.

## How it Helps

Debate is a good way to improve public speaking, but also research experience and writing. You also need to take impressive notes in order to know what your adversary is saying. The more I debate, the more comfortable I am writing persuasive content and expressing my ideas verbally.

## My Example

NEGATE

I negate the topic: this house believes that animal testing should be banned.

Scientific Consensus also concludes that 92% of scientists confirm that animal research is essential for the advancement of biomedical research. This means that if animal testing should be banned, the advancement would come to a rapid stop and drain new hope away from discoveries of new cures and therapies to patients. Although we can use modeled tissues, cells, diagrams, volunteer people, and other methods, there are vital questions that can ONLY be answered using animals! Dario Ringach, Professor of Neurobiology and Psychology in the Jules Stein Eye Institute and in the Brain Research Institute at University of California at Los Angeles

It is proven that animals have increased our survival rates through multiple diseases, one of those including cancer. Over the past 40 years, the survival rates of overall cancer types went from 50% to 70% partially due to animal testing. But that is only 1 disease, there are many more including Penicillin, Blood transfusion, Tuberculosis, Macular degeneration, AsthmaMeningitis, Kidney Transplants, Parkinson" disease, Insulin. said Robert Palazzo, Ph.D, President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

Animal testing also saves animals, believe it or not. In fact, animal testing has resulted in many life-extending cures from diseases that your household dogs may encounter, or farm animals that provide us with eggs, milk, and more, or even endangered species that we long to see and look at ranging from pandas to tigers. All biomedical researches not only advance the lives of us humans but also our animals and the world around us. And although the purpose of animal testing is to help us humans live, many of the cancers, epilepsy, and other diseases also apply to animals and will help them out too. Further, Not all animal testing harms animals, In the national zoo of Washington D.C. Orangutangs, contribute to research freely without harm. They can move around between buildings, and climb on ropes without any disruption. While doing this, they still contribute and help out researchers and their investigations. "Americans are living longer, healthier lives and we owe much of that success to biomedical research," said Robert Palazzo, Ph.D, President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
